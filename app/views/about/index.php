            <h2>My Journey as an Artist</h2>
            
            <p>
                Welcome! I'm Zo, and art has been my passion for as long as I can remember. 
                My journey began in childhood, where I found solace and expression through colors, 
                shapes, and the stories they could tell.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Over the years, I've explored various media including acrylics, watercolors, oils, 
                and mixed media. Each medium offers its own unique voice, and I love discovering 
                new ways to express emotions, capture moments, and connect with viewers through 
                my work.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                My artwork is inspired by nature, human emotions, and the beauty found in everyday 
                moments. I believe that art has the power to heal, inspire, and bring people together. 
                Through my paintings, I aim to create pieces that resonate with viewers on a personal 
                level and bring joy to their spaces.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Teaching & Community</h3>
            
            <p>
                Beyond creating art, I'm passionate about sharing my knowledge and helping others 
                discover their creative potential. Teaching art allows me to give back to the 
                community and inspire the next generation of artists.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In my classes and workshops, I focus on creating a supportive environment where 
                students feel comfortable experimenting, making mistakes, and growing. Whether 
                you're picking up a brush for the first time or refining advanced techniques, 
                I'm here to guide and encourage you on your artistic journey.
